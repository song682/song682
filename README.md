- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @song682
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in painting, transltion, etc. They're all based on the interest.  
 If I makes some troubles, I'm way sorry for that bad behavior.
 I don't say much English or Russia, and sometimes I always made some grammar mistake and be impolite to you.I didn't really want that.  
 Juvenile cat. In summary.
